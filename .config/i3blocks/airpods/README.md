## Tweak the script for first time
replace MAC and card name in the script
```
AIRPODS_MAC='4C:6B:E8:80:46:84' # it should be somewhere in blueman-manager  
AIRPODS_NAME='bluez_card.4C_6B_E8_80_46_84' # you can find this using 'pactl list cards' command  
```

## i3blocks.conf
```
[airpods]
command=/path/to/airpods
label=ðŸŽ§ 
interval=10
```

## Note
you should first pair your airpods using blueman and trust them to use this script
